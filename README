To build OpenGL programs simply invoke "make" command.  It will create
a temporary "objs" directory and a "dist" directory containing
executable files.

The package contains two applications:
* solar -- a simulation of the Solar system.  No physics are applied
           in it, only a bunch of spheres flying around each other.
* physics -- a physics simulator.

To build documentation call "make doc" which will build HTML
documentation in doc/html/index.html -- for further information you
should refer to this file.
